DB Project - Through this project work, we aim to create a simplified version of an android app (if possible web app also). The application will act as a portal which provides itâ€™s users with various services like Online Food ordering, Medical services, Room Booking etc from your seat just using your PNR number. It also provides Wallet services with order tracking system if possible from very popular restaurants and hospitals. The aim is to learn how to create an application which uses a database in its backend. We also plan to make the application safe and secure so that it is not susceptible to vulnerabilities and security attacks.
